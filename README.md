https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data.  
The goal of the competition is correctly classify handwritten numbers from the MNIST data set using computer vision.

The intent with the project is to display proficiency in using Neural Netowrk structures in a practical context.  

### Scripts
The following scripts are used for completing the competition.

1.  data_load.py loads the MNIST data and converts it from .csv format to matrix structure.
2.



### CNN
The following is a short description of the implemented Convolutional Neural Network.
